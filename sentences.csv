The non-specific reading has this order reversed, in the sense of $x$ seeking some or other $y$ with a certain property. In Kilmeri, by contrast, there is no scope ambiguity involved at all. Instead, in the non-specific reading of some or other frog being sought the feature [-\textsc{anim}] is assigned via the verb form \textit{riye} in the second clause, and once a specific frog is talked about, we find the feature [+\textsc{anim}] via the choice of the existential-postural verb \textit{nake}, in the fourth clause of Sequence (\ref{ex:t3exkonumo}).",C_03_4-lelo,5,kilm1241,kilm1241a,WORD_ALIGNED,"{""PP"": ""punctual past"", ""INANIM"": ""inanimate"", ""LV"": ""light verb"", ""DFAC"": ""deictic-factual"", ""LOC"": ""locative""}"

A_01_4-am,1,Am,"The story of Am waThe text begins with a genealogical overview of the narrator Usi Kul and his clan. He then continues with the story of the ancestor Am, as announced in Sequence 5. However, in Sequence 9 a person called Bu is introduced who is supposed to fulfil people’s basic needs. Am, on the other hand, is associated with the upbringing of boys and social life in general (Sequences 10-14). In the past, it was common for boys to be separated from their mothers at a certain age and grow up in a male-dominated environment. Interestingly, four women are mentioned who took care of the boys in this male-dominated world. They may have been foster mothers and even breastfed the boys. This has not been confirmed, however. Then it continues with some historical facts about the settlement and how the settlements have changed. Access to water is important, but so is the personal connection to a particular piece of land. Finally, the story ends with a reference to Bu and Am, both of which seem to be of equal importance. In essence, the story of Am represents the genealogical lineage of the clans of the people living in Omoi and the surrounding hamlets today. The narrator blends the local indigenous tradition with modern developments; in particular, he interprets the loss of the old male cult houses of discussion and consensus, namely the house tambaran, in the light of the new House of Parliament in Port Moresby, where the nationwide political debates now take place. Secondly, he integrates a Christian biblical figure, namely Noah, as an ancestor who gave the people special power, thus relating them to God as the ultimate creator. Seen from the outside, the parallelism of two completely different ancestral lines may seem strange; for the people themselves, it is very probably an attempt to anchor themselves in both worlds, the traditional and the modern. In economic terms, the ancient period is often talked about as a “golden age” in which people lived in abundance.s originally told by Usi Kul in Onume/Omoi village in Septem- ber 2000. Usi Kul tells the story of his ancestors and their way of life as he in- terprets it in the light of the “new world” that the people experience after the encounter with the whites. The story was then retold by Margaret Osi in an abridged version, which was subsequently transcribed. It should be mentioned that Usi Kul also gave a version of the story in Tok Pisin. In this version he included parlando phrases which made his narrative performance very special. Most of the names of persons and clans he presented in this parlando mode. I include his Tok Pisin version as a parallel text at the end of this chapter.",Usi Kul,"Usi Kul. 2026. Am. In Claudia Gerstner-Link (ed.), Clans, spirits, land and food Kilmeri texts.

A_02_4-si,2,Si yelo piyo ,"The text provides the genealogy of the clan of Lis Osi, late husband of Margaret Osi (Sequences 1-5). The social organisation of the Kilmeri is strictly patrilineal. Lis Osi is a member of the greater Imop clan that split into several subclans whose members now live in Ossima, Isi I, and Isi II, respectively. Lis Osi is called Imop eme, which means ‘of Imop origin’. The second part of the text describes Si’s land appropriation, starting with Sequence 6. Some of the sections of bush claimed by him are named and explic- itly listed here, and the names go back to people who died a long time ago. In Sequence 8, the separation of the lineage between Isi Daru and Ossima is men- tioned. The long journey of Si corresponds to the fact that the eastern villages, including Ossima, are the furthest away from the swampy basin around Bewani, which is where the first arrivals from the west came. This migration route of the Kilmeri can also be verified linguistically (Gerstner-Link 2023). The journey itself is not mentioned; the main purpose of this narrative is to substantiate the land claims in the Puwani-Pual basin. The importance of this kind of oral tradition is shown by the fact that Margaret Osi recited it to me twice, three years apart. Today, land claims are crucial for the distribution of royalties from logging.",Margaret Osi,"Margaret Osi. 2026. Si yelo piyo .

A_03_4-sak,3,Sakou,"The story recounts the creation of the ``golden world'' in which the Kilmeri once lived. Sakou was the creator of all kinds of food, especially wild animals and sago. He grew up as an abandoned boy far away from his family and lived alone in the forest. By staying in a tree, he was able to sustain himself. Through clever behaviour, he also managed to trick an evil bush spirit and get rid of it. He eventually moved to a second tree that grew very tall. Two sisters were living in its crown and took care of him. When the bush spirit returned, the three people tried to trick it. At first, the two women tried to overpower it, but without success. Finally, Sakou came up with the idea of feeding the people of a village to the bush spirit. The bush spirit was unsuccessful in devouring a large man, whereupon it died. After the bush spirit's death, the three returned to Sakou's original village, where his nephew recognised him as his uncle. The clan welcomed him, but Sakou saw that the people were eating poor food. So he showed them what he himself was eating. Whilst the people were asleep, he scattered all kinds of seeds on the ground, and after sunrise, in the early morning, the world looked different and offered plenty of good food. Since then, all the clans have been living together with Sakou.  The outline of the story is: (i) The hero grows up away from his family, (ii) he defeats a bush spirit, sacrificing the inhabitants of an entire village in the process, (iii) he receives support from two women, (iv) he returns to his people and his village and helps them to a much better life.  An interpretation of the story leads to the question why an entire village was sacrificed. We can even rephrase the question as: The inhabitants of which village were massacred? The answer to this is speculative, but it may reflect the fact that the Kilmeri invaded the Pual Puwani river basin. So the story would describe the displacement and killing of the putative former inhabitants. These earlier people may have travelled inland from the coast and had a different diet, more fish and less sago. This would explain two details of the story. Firstly, even Sakou's own people had ``fish mouths''; and secondly, Sakou was the creator of wild animals and various types of nutritious sago. In addition, the bush spirit, as a representative of evil, is a legacy of the forest people inland.  ",Margaret Osi,"Margaret Osi. 2026. Sakou.

A_04_4-saul,4,Haus Tambaran,"The text is Margaret Osi's personal recollection of the time and lifestyle before modern development came along with the Australian colonial administration and the Catholic mission. Margaret was about twenty years old at the time the mission was established. As a teenager, she would accompany her father to Vanimo and experienced the early days of the town. However, life in the bush was still very traditional back then. Margaret's generation is thus the last to have grown up on the firm ground of indigenous heritage.  The stories of \textit{Am} (\textref{sc0201}), \textit{Sakou} (\textref{sc0302}), and \textit{Haus Tambaran} all revolve around the availability of food. The heroes Am/Bu and Sakou are well known for providing food, and the stories are dedicated to their memory. The ceremonies that took place at the \textit{haus tambaran} likewise served the purpose of securing food. The staple food that is mentioned again and again is sago, together with game meat. Such food is the basic prerequisite for any further prosperity. Interestingly, rice is also mentioned as a foodstuff in the story of Am (Text \ref{sc0201}, Sequence \ref{ex:nrexpalime}).

A_05_4-wap,5,Wapues,"The young girl Wapues was abandoned by her family and left alone in the bush. One day, a stranger came to her bush house wanting to stay with her. He looked ugly, black and fat and she wanted to get rid of him. While she was away in the sago swamp, he went to the river and cleansed his body of all the salt it contained. In this way, it is said, he introduced people to the resource of salt. Consequently, his appearance changed, and he became young and handsome. As a result, the girl accepted him as her husband, and they had five children. Together with their son, Wapues' parents left the old village of Ossima to look for a new, perhaps more resourceful place. Wapues and her husband Siyu stayed in Ossima.  The name Siyu suggests that the bearer's ancestry goes back to the ancestor Si. Possibly the name means ‘Si place’ and contains the noun \textit{yo} ‘place’. The name \textit{Siyu} was sometimes pronounced as \textit{Siyou}.  Interpretation and message: The story bears witness to the founding of a new settlement, the present-day village of Omula and its surroundings. It also attests to the common practice of exchanging wives between clans, as Wapues’ clan is obliged to provide wives to Siyu’s clan that settles in Ossima. The girls had to give up their ties to their families in favour of their husbands' families. This does not seem to have been easy, as shown by the image of the adult Wapues still clinging to her mother's breast. Wapues is reluctant to fulfil her marital duties.  Finally, the story explains the origin of salt as a resource. ",Margaret Osi,"Margaret Osi. 2026. Wapues. In Claudia Gerstner-Link (ed.), Clans, spirits, land and food Kilmeri texts.

A_06_4-raun,6,The spellbound lake,"The story is about how a clan got punished for neglecting two orphaned children. The orphaned children left their village, went into the bush and met their ``grandmother'' who dwells like a bush spirit at the bottom of a pond. The grandmother supported the children and she causes heavy rainfall through magic (Sequence \ref{ex:nrexsilpok}). The first effect of the rain was frogs and fish appearing in abundance, which the people collected. The second effect was a flood in which people drowned (Sequence \ref{ex:nrexinerna}). The remaining people were killed by a man named Buoko, whose identity is unclear. Two entire clans were wiped out (Sequence \ref{ex:nrexinuges}). A second man named Amou, whose pregnant wife died in the flood, takes revenge and kills Buoko. (Sequences \ref{ex:nrexolasau}/\ref{ex:nrexsepuep}). Amou was the last surviving member of the Inuges clan.  Originally the story was told by Sei Walup (see Section \ref{saiwalup}). For better understanding, I suggested that he should first narrate it in Tok Pisin and then repeat the story in Kilmeri. Unfortunately, the Kilmeri version is only an abridged version of the detailed Tok Pisin version and is barely comprehensible. In addition, the second version features so much code-switching, that one cannot speak of a Kilmeri text. In retrospect, it would have been better to arrange a second visit to him, focussing solely on Kilmeri.  There are some narrative differences between Sei's Tok Pisin version and Margaret's Kilmeri version. Firstly, Sei starts with an overview embedding the story into the clan context. In particular, he says that the story is not `his story', but he says in Tok Pisin: \textit{na stori bilong mi --- i no bilong mi, bilong olgeta man, man bilong mipela wanpela tokples i stap}, which means `and my story --- it isn't my story, it belongs to all people, the people of us are one language (community) for ever'. The ownership of the story is extended to the entire community of the fifteen Kilmeri-speaking villages, although it only reports on the fate of a single clan. This is an important indication that the people have a strong sense of shared identity and history. The story relates directly to the village and people of Isi. In fact, Sei mentions three place names: Ia, Isi, and Awol. Sei also confirms that the disputed body of water had another, older name: Kisi. In his introduction he says: \textit{Mi laik kirapim dispela stori nau. Nem bilong mi Sei Walup. Mi laik wokim mipela Awol stret. Mi wokim wara nau. Na Ppulae, wara Ppulae. Nem bilong em Kisi.} `I want to start with the story. My name is Sei Walup. I want to tell a story about us people in Awol. I'll tell about a small lake, about ``Bad water'' lake. Before it was called lake Kisi.' Only after the dramatic incident described in the story did the lake become known as \textit{ppulae} `bad'.   Furthermore, Sei mentions the spirit woman who lives at the bottom of the original pond. She is called \textit{memi} `grandmother' by the children. This detail is relevant, because in Sei's version it is the husband Beko, not the spirit woman, who performs the rain magic. Thus, the husband is responsible for the death of the clans. An old Nimboran myth (\cite[31]{Kouwenhoven:1956mg}) tells of the female supernatural being \textit{Indjo}, who lives in the mountain rivers in the south of the Nimboran territory and whose power was feared. Should she become angry, she would send rain and thunder and drown the earth. Given the presumed homeland of the Kilmeri people, there may be a narrative link between the Nimboran oral tradition and this Kilmeri story: Apparently the villagers broke a social rule by neglecting orphaned children, and this was penalised by the spirit woman through her command over the rain and her ability to flood the earth. Margaret Osi preserved the female nature of the creator of the flood, while Sei Walup chose a male one. He also tells us that the two orphans drown in the rising waters. The role of Buoko in Margaret's version is not entirely clear. He may have killed some survivors of the flood or people from another village nearby.   Finally, concluding the story Sei reinforces his reliability with the Tok Pisin words \textit{Olsem mi no giaman, trupela tok mi tok, \textbf{bo makina kopi muli}, tokples nau ... em tasol, sapos \textbf{app} i nogat lus em tasol, dispela stori em tasol} (Kilmeri phrases are in bold font), which translates as: `Thus I don't lie, I said the truth, I am speaking my words good, in (my) vernacular now ... that's it, if the sky is not lost, that's it, this story now ends'. This is much more than the usual formulae used at the end of stories. He emphasises the dramatic and perhaps even traumatic events.  The location of the small mountain or hill called Asaul in Sequence (\ref{ex:nrexolasau}) is unclear. However, the location of \textit{Pu ppulae}, the ‘bad water’, is known. It is a lake about 1 km long and 100-120 m wide west of the Puwani River and south-east of the settlements of Awol. Its natural origin and geological composition are unclear. While the course of the Puwani has changed to some extent over the decades -- people are aware of this -- the lake is unlikely to be an ancient branch of the river. The Google Earth view shows a blue coloured body of water, while the rivers and old river branches in the area are brownish in colour because of the sediments they carry. The lake can therefore be said to be a stagnant body of water with no obvious inflow or outflow. It is difficult to access as it is completely surrounded by reeds, and a swamp area extends about 300 metres to the east. The quality of the water is said to be poor, probably a little salty or alkaline, and it is compared to the salty sea, \textit{olsem solwara} in Tok Pisin.   \textit{Pu ppulae} is a taboo place. The inhabitants of Awol and Iulep, to whose land it belongs, do not catch fish in the lake and do not go there to bathe. People are allowed to visit the place, but may not touch it. The collective memory of the place where an ancestral clan perished is still vivid, and it is believed that it is inhabited by the spirits of the dead. White people are not normally allowed to enter the lake, but my family were escorted to the lake by the storyteller Sei Walup and two other men from the village.  People are still familiar with the ginger magic that can be used to bring about rain. On one occasion, Margaret Osi told me about a man from Isi camp who knows rain magic and who performed the ritual in very hot and dry weather. ",Margaret Osi,"Margaret Osi. 2026. The spellbound lake.

A_08_4-ome,8,Ome na Lapi,"The story goes back to the knowledge of John Sol from Isi Camp, a hamlet about 1 km from Ossima. There is a wide expanse of metre-high \textit{kunai} grass (\textit{Imperata cylindrica}) between the houses of Isi Camp and the Puwani River, which you have to cross to reach the sandy riverbank. The inhabitants of Isi Camp are from the village of Isi, 3-4 km south of Kiliwes. As they belong to the larger Imo clan, they were permitted to settle in the area of Ossima, which is also a settlement of the Imo clan. The large fissure in the earth near Kiliwes is called Yi.  The Sequences \ref{ex:nrexseiwel}-\ref{ex:nrexwilkob} are a free association that follow the actual story line. The ``exchange'' of weapons implies a sense of great loss after the arrival of the whites, who seemed to be so much stronger.  ",Margaret Osi,"Margaret Osi. 2026. Ome na Lapi.

A_09_4-bue,9,Bue,"Brigitte Esau mapped out the route through the bush by naming several places that the ancestor Wumeye visited (\figref{fig:sketchomoi}). He set off from the Pual River near Omoi. First he reached the Apilaua hillside and the Pusemo stream. Next he reached the second hill and the hamlet of Wupepp, where he spent the night. This place is mentioned in the story. Then he crossed the Puwalei stream and passed Walili, the last village (or even the last settlement?) before reaching the coast. Now he arrived at the coast at Okuli, where he made camp. People would later boil salt water at this place to extract salt.  Unfortunately, the names mentioned by Brigitte Esau could not be identified on official maps (\cite[Sheet 7192]{Australia.-Army.-Royal-Australian-Survey-Corps:1969fx}). The places were ``in use'' a century ago or even longer. Today they are only recognisable to people who are familiar with all the details of the oral history.  The text confirms the argument that the Kilmeri are an inland people who first had to ``discover'' the coast and the sea.  ",Brigitte Esau,"Brigitte Esau. 2026. Bue.

B_02_4-urbek,11,Urual bekulu,"This story depicts the encounter of a hunter with a huge lizard that is later interpreted as a bush spirit. The hunter who roamed the bush alone is killed by the lizard. The term \textit{urual} is glossed here as `lizard', because this is the translation that the people themselves gave. In order to understand the physical power of the creature it makes sense to search for its biological and scientific identity. The description in the story and further explanations by the story tellers, especially by Susan Bisam, led to the species \textit{Varanus salvadorii} (Ordo: Squamata; without rank: Toxicofera). In English it is called ``the Papuan monitor,'' which denotes a varanoid saurian endemic to New Guinea. The animal is more than 2.5 m long, and it weighs well over 6 kg. It has extremely sharp and long teeth. Its limbs and claws are very strong and look quite big compared to the body.  All these features were known to Susan Bisam, in particular the strength of its limbs and the dangerous teeth. There is no doubt that when Susan was growing up, the hunters of the time had to be wary of these animals. The habitat of \textit{Varanus salvadorii} is rainforests and swamps between the coast and the interior at altitudes of up to 600 metres. It lives in trees and jumps from branch to branch, using its long tail for balance. It feeds on small mammals, birds and eggs, but also on insects -- in swampy areas it may even feed on sago grubs. Humans are therefore not prey for these monitor lizards, but they can fall victim to their aggressiveness when competing with them for prey animals such as possums or tree kangaroos. Some species of the Varanidae family are toxic and have venom glands. It seems possible that \textit{Varanus salvadorii} also has poisonous glands, as its bites are apparently fatal.  What is said above seems to be a reasonable background for the following story. Reference to the protagonist as a ``lizard'' occurs 10 times (Sequences \ref{ex:nrexpoehur}(3x), \ref{ex:nrexmaroip}, \ref{ex:nrexkpiowo}, \ref{ex:nrexolekiu}, \ref{ex:nrexpuawom}, \ref{ex:nrexwaplay}, \ref{ex:nrexwepusu}, \ref{ex:nrexlebaul}), whereas it is referred to as ``bush spirit'' 6 times (Sequences \ref{ex:nrexolekiu}, \ref{ex:nrexpuawom}, \ref{ex:nrexlebaul}(4x)). The creature displays almost supernatural powers, as it is able to split the ironwood tree in two, in which the older brother (i.e., the victim) was hiding. This is, of course, a narrative exaggeration. Nevertheless, the base of its tail can be enormously strong.   I may add a comment on Sequence \ref{ex:nrexomosop}, which sounds more like a raid than a revenge, as it lists both traditional and modern items taken from the bush spirit. In the past, clans have indeed raided other settlements out of revenge or simply out of need.  ",Susam Bisam and,"Susam Bisam and. 2026. Urual bekulu.

B_03_4-walpop,12,Walpop bo,"The Kilmeri title of the story, \textit{Walpop bo}, was chosen by Margaret Osi herself. It translates as `story of a small turtle'. The story revolves around a small turtle whose tracks two sisters saw on the riverbank while catching fish. The word \textit{walpop} refers to a small kind of turtle. Such an animal does not have much meat, and therefore provides only a small addition to a meal. Nevertheless, one of the sisters wants to get it, even though they have already filled two baskets with fish. Climbing the often steep bank of a river can be dangerous as one might lose one's hold. The story could therefore be read as a warning not to do anything rash that is not worthwhile.   Further on, the story features a man who helps the unfortunate sister and takes her back to her village and her family. The generous behaviour of a stranger is culturally surprising. Normally, a stranger would seduce a lonely woman whom he meets by chance in the forest. Here, the contrary is happening.  ",Susan Bisam and Margaret Osi,"Susan Bisam and Margaret Osi. 2026.

She seemed to be lucky, but the many fish she had caught turned out to be the gift of an evil spirit. The spirit did not show itself at the river, but only appeared on her family's doorstep the next morning. Then it demanded that the girl marry it. There was no way out of this situation and, thus, the girl Kusudua followed it down into the river, where both changed into snakes.  It is interesting to note that the sisters fished separately. One is said to have stayed upstream, the other downstream. This fact may indicate a potentially dangerous situation, as the sisters cannot help each other if one of them falls and is caught in a whirlpool. The story could therefore be understood as a warning to stay together and not fish on slippery rocks in the middle of the river. Otherwise one could drown. ",Brigitte Esau,"Brigitte Esau. 2026.

B_06_4-paek,15,Pu paek,"A father is accompanied by his son on a hunting trip into the bush. The son is told to stay near the bush hut while the father goes hunting alone. Left alone, the son is visited by a bush spirit. The spirit measures the beds to find out which is his father's bed. It also warns the child that it will come back the next night and eat his father. The son is suspicious of the visitor and tells his father everything. The father doesn't believe a word he says and just wants him to enjoy the delicious food. But the son is right, and that night the bush spirit returns and kills the father. The clan then takes revenge and kills the bush spirit.  The moral of the story is that the deep forest is always a potentially dangerous place. One must always exercise caution. Certainly it is not the right place to eat large meals and then rest in a sound sleep without hearing warning noises. This is exactly what happened to the father. When transcribing the text with Margaret Osi, she told me that the father's sleeping position indicates deep sleep (Sequence \ref{ex:t2exvonuro}). So the father did not demonstrate the kind of behaviour required to withstand the challenges of the bush.  Some remarks to style and grammar of the narrator: Although grammatically mandatory, the narrator rarely uses the affixal dual of the verb. Instead, he often uses the prefix of accompaniment with a similar function. He also makes frequent use of topicalised pronouns for emphasis, while emphatic pronouns are not used. Furthermore, the text shows code-switching to Tok Pisin.  ",Andrew Wapi ,"Andrew Wapi . 2026. Pu paek. In Claudia Gerstner-Link (ed.), Clans, spirits, land and food Kilmeri texts.

B_08_4-urai,17,Urai ako wiye,"When a married couple returned from a stay in the bush and a successful hunt, they encountered a crocodile while crossing a river. The woman was caught by the crocodile, which turned out to be a bush spirit. The villagers tried to free her from the evil spirit, but it had already eaten all but a few remains of this human meal. The remaining bodyparts were given a usual Christian burial. This story combines a death due to the old way of life with a newly introduced Christian custom.  Like all the large rivers in the area, the Puwani was also the habitat of crocodiles. The crocodile population must have been quite large, otherwise the crocodile hunters would not have come to the village. It therefore makes sense that there would have been crocodile attacks and villagers would have fallen victim to these predatory animals. It is likely that after a person was killed by a crocodile, other people tried to recover a limb or the head of the deceased by diving into the river, as the story tells us.

These underwater creatures are potentially dangerous for the visitor Wau and he is advised to leave this place as quickly as possible.

For a more elaborated version of the story see \nocite{Slone:2001ux} \citet[591-592]{Slone:2001uz}: ``Why Cassowaries Do Not Fly Anymore''.   The cassowary is a flightless bird, although it has the phenotypic characteristics of a bird. This obvious discrepancy had to be explained and probably motivated people to invent a story. In Kilmeri folk taxonomy, cassowaries are not categorised as birds but as ground-living animals such as pigs, kangaroos, possums, rats, etc. ",Margaret Osi ,"Margaret Osi . 2026. Nini na wîs.

The victim was still alive a few days after the attack, but it is said that he was still killed by the attack. Here Margaret adopts the widespread line of argument that a person's death is never caused by medical problems but by human intervention, especially sorcery (see \cite[14-15]{Gerstner-Link:2018un}). This position was not discussed between her and me.  The story begins with the wizards' ambush after her father Apai has had a happy hunting experience. Then the sick man is taken from the bush hut to Ninggera and from there to Pasi near Vanimo. Instead of seeking help at the hospital in Vanimo, he was taken further to the villages -- probably to Omoi -- and to his relatives. He soon died there and then was given a Christian burial.

Sometimes the children are carried in a big bilum while they work, sometimes they are placed on a \textit{pangal} platform to sleep. This is an opportunity for the spirits to invade the child's mind and disturb its rest. The child can no longer be soothed by breastfeeding. A magical ritual must be performed with a specific plant to drive the spirits away. The leaves and bark used for the ritual could not be identified. The bark, which is chewed and spat on the child, may contain a calming substance.   One possible natural reason for the baby's restlessness is the omnipresent insects in the sago swamp and, to a lesser extent, in its own home. ",Margaret Osi ,"Margaret Osi . 2026. Ruri Epek.

Often the family works together, but in this story it is only the mother and her young daughter who go to the swamp together. It is commonly assumed that children are fairly independent once they are able to walk properly and climb smaller palm trees. They would look for something to eat during the long hours in the swamp. When they were hungry, they would look for small animals such as geckos and frogs and roast them in the fire. Here Margaret Osi recalls her own childhood. Back then, she took pride in catching these small creatures, which would be the only food or sometimes a nice addition to a small portion of sago jelly prepared by her mother.  When I was invited to accompany Susan Bisam to the swamp, she cut down a young palm tree to eat the white flesh at its upper end. It looked like a 30 to 40 cm high cone and tasted fresh.

C_04_4-lopos,26,Ai kopi yip papi,"The house that Margaret's father built is a family home. The events described took place around six decades ago, but the construction technique she describes is still used today. The only difference is the use of nails instead of ropes. My own house was also built the way Margaret describes. The supporting posts, which are anchored in the ground, are usually made of ironwood (\textit{Intsia bijuga}), a hard wood. The floor of the house is about 1 metre (or even higher) from the ground.  The use of six support posts results in a house that is about 6 metres long and 3 metres wide. That's a rather small floor plan. As we see in Sequence \ref{ex:nrexbaesli}, the fireplace was inside the house. Nowadays, people often have a separate kitchen house (\textit{haus kuk} in Tok Pisin) of about 6 square metres where all meals are prepared. Traditionally, the Kilmeri had single-family houses owned by one family. The communal houses included a house for adolescent men and the men's house for ritual purposes. The latter were absolutely taboo for women (see \textref{sc0204}). Each village had its own men's house (\textit{haus tambaran} in Tok Pisin), and the men would sleep and eat there (see Sequence (\ref{ex:nrexdupuni}) below). This was also the place for conversations and discussions. The spheres of life of men and women were thus relatively separate - a fact that Margaret Osi often repeats when she comments on the ``modern'' way of life. Above all, women did not have as many children as they do today. According to her, four children were normal compared to six to eight children today.    Some remarks to Margaret Osi's narrative style: The work steps are usually described in two clauses. First the action clause appears in the punctual past tense, and then the result is given in a separate clause in the modality of resultative factuality. The descriptive sequence of action and result, repeated for each work step, depicts the process of building the house perfectly. Note also the list of words and phrases indicating daybreak in Sequence (\ref{ex:nrexdupuni}). This adds a poetic touch to the scenery and the narrative. The sunrise itself cannot be seen in the forest. But you can see the change from black to grey to light. ",Margaret Osi ,"Margaret Osi . 2026. Ai kopi yip papi.

This story is not the only Kilmeri source for this procedure. During a visit to the village of Awol, the local consultants also spoke of this tradition, which had only recently disappeared.  This method of treating corpses is widespread. It has also been documented for the Simog and Daonda people, who both speak a language of the Border family, south of the Bewani Mountains (\cite[223]{Seiler:1985vo}). The bones of the deceased are preserved and are supposed to transfer the power of his or her spirit to the living. They are usually carried in a (special?) net bag and are part of the hunting gear when a close relative of the deceased goes hunting (see Sequence (\ref{ex:t6exkaepul})). This bone-related custom has also been reported for the Telefomin people, who live on the upper reaches of the Sepik (\cite{craig2018}).    The conceptual difference between the traditional and the Christian way of burying the dead seems to be as follows: In the past, the dead were placed in a tree, whereas today they are enclosed in a coffin and placed in the ground. A tree might symbolise openness, while a coffin covered with earth symbolises the locking up of the dead. This may mean that it is believed that the spirits of the dead are no longer able to help the living.  ",Margaret Osi ,"Margaret Osi . 2026. Ono basuiko.

The story tells us that this animal was previously hunted for its meat. I assume that Andrew Wapi witnessed such hunting activities when he was young. The final sequence states that these lizards were common in the lowland forests and gives advice on how to kill them.  In this story, the deceased is buried in the ground, but without a coffin. The wake he received is a traditional custom. This part of the ritual after a death in the village is missing in \textref{sc0405} above. The reason for this could be that the man in question died in the bush and was not transferred to the village before the cremation ritual took place. I was told that such cremations never took place near settlements, but some distance away in the bush. ",Andrew Wapi w,"Andrew Wapi w. 2026. Urual.

C_07_4-diri,29,Diri wor dop lo,"This hunting story is about a supernatural power that enables the younger of the two brothers to change his appearance. He transformed into a dog and behaved like a hunting dog. In this way, he managed to secure two tree kangaroos as prey. The older brother did not notice the younger brother's transformation (see Sequence (\ref{ex:nrexkosiye})). He only became aware of it later in Sequence (\ref{ex:nrexwoworr}). After the hunt, the younger brother miraculously regains his human form. The story is set at a bush camp, and such camps are usually established in the deep forest for a few days in order to procure new food supplies. Therefore, the younger brother did not enter the main village in his changed appearance.  Dogs are indispensable for hunting marsupials. Hunters knock or shoot them down from trees and the dogs catch them on the ground (cf. \cite[135-138]{Brumbaugh:1984tn}).   Andrew Wapi's text contains some code-switching to Tok Pisin. Notably, we find Tok Pisin combined with the Kilmeri light verb \textit{pi}, for example \textit{kamap-pi} `become', \textit{tanim-pi} and \textit{senis-pi}, both `change'. An example is Sequence (\ref{ex:nrexkowors}). Even though the change of appearance is a narrative topos and an established concept in the Kilmeri tradition, there does not seem to be a verb with this meaning. In the story \textit{Wapues} (\textref{sc0205}) in Sequence (\ref{ex:nrexaesika}), the phrase \textit{dop kep pûke} `lose his skin' is used, but it is followed by Tok Pisin \textit{kamap-pi} and \textit{senis-pi}. In the story \textit{Kusudua} (\textref{sc0304}) in Sequence (\ref{ex:nrexduapon}), the expression \textit{dop kep poname} `give his skin to sb' occurs, again followed by \textit{senis-pi}. For the Tok Pisin verb \textit{lukautim} `take care of' there is a clear equivalent in Kilmeri, viz., \textit{yai} `take care of'. At the same time, the speaker uses Kilmeri serial verbs when necessary, for example in Sequences (\ref{ex:nrexlippue}), (\ref{ex:nrexsskaka}), (\ref{ex:nrexbipued}), (\ref{ex:nrexastaim}), (\ref{ex:nrexdiriim}), and (\ref{ex:nrexmikimi}), and thus exhibits good language competence.  Another comment concerns the narrator's style. The text is characterised by a lot of repetition. For example, the fact that the younger brother has turned into a dog is repeated several times. The catching and killing of the tree kangaroos is also repeated several times with almost the same wording. As a result, the text is not a fluid narrative. Instead, the narrator appears to constantly reassure himself about the plot.  ",Andrew Wapi w,"Andrew Wapi w. 2026. Diri wor dop lo.

No woman makes them these days. So Margaret Osi's description remained somewhat theoretical for me.

Such a tube served as a kind of pot. Because of the small diameter, several such tubes were needed to prepare a single meal. The tubes also needed a firm base.

Along with this kind of mental framing, she tells of her  adolesent life in steps that correspond to those of girls and young women of the same age. The capacity of helping one's parents in daily life is a big step in growing up. It prepares young women for their future responsibilities after marriage. Margaret herself did not marry early. She mentions three times that she currently lives on her own (Sequences \ref{ex:nrexppilin}, \ref{ex:nrexboyonu} and \ref{ex:nrexmemiko}).

The husband was the head of the village at the time. He made all the decisions and arrangements for the Catholic mission in Ossima. Obviously there was some tension between the stepbrothers, i.e., the sons from the two wives, which I could witness myself. The fact that Margaret had usurped the position of Lis Osi's wife may have been one of the reasons why his firstborn son Paul Waia  killed Margaret's sow (Sequence \ref{ex:nrexpaulwa}). Margaret's own oldest (surviving) son David seemed to have a certain influence in the village by mediating disputes.   Margaret always admired the staff at the Mission. The head of the agricultural section of the Mission, Brother James Coucher CP, was a charismatic personality and was adored by all the villagers and the wider community. His esteem is apparent in Sequences \ref{ex:nrexyaeaul}-\ref{ex:nrexepueka}. The private cattle business also continued after `Brother Jim' had left Ossima. For example, I was able to buy a cow for Margaret from one of the cattle owners. Margaret was proud to be the owner of a cow and was happy when her cow became pregnant.

After the crocodile's attack, a thorough search was launched for the remains of the victim. Part of his body was found in the crocodile's stomach. The remains of the man were later buried in a coffin like an intact corpse. This corresponds to the practice described in the crocodile bush spirit story (cf. \textref{sc0307}). From this we can conclude that it was crucial to guide the deceased, represented by the corpse (or at least some of its remains), into the world of spirits through an appropriate ritual, be it traditional or Christian.

In the end, she was very fortunate as the wound healed quickly. ",Susan Bisam,"Susan Bisam. 2026. Ul ko lu. In Claudia Gerstner-Link (ed.), Clans, spirits, land and food Kilmeri texts.

The platform is like an open veranda without railings. When you put down a heavy load -- wet sago or firewood or a basket of coconuts -- you have to be careful to maintain balance. Susan was probably exhausted and wanted to quickly get rid of the load. That is how the accident happened.   Once again we see that sago processing is Susan's way of life. In her home village, she received no support from her brothers. After the death of her husband, she was living alone having to feed four children. Sago makes up a family's staple diet. This meant that Susan had to do her sago work almost every day. Only the older ones of her twelve children were able to provide for themselves in their own families.

Wild fowl eggs are a much appreciated addition to meals, especially as chicken eggs are not usually eaten but left to hatch. The location of the nest was about half an hour from the houses of Osi Camp, passing the spot where Margaret and her husband had their small bush hut. Then the track led into the forest. After a while, between the buttressed trunk of a \textit{kwila} tree (\textit{Intsia bijuga}), we saw the big nest of a wild fowl, which is a large ground- breeding bird.

Many of the villagers used to walk to town, and Margaret did this quite often. The purpose of the journey was both to meet relatives who lived in Vanimo and just to be in town. She wanted to experience the atmosphere of the town, a motivating factor for the trip that should not be underestimated.

Mili's mother could not accompany her because of their other four children. So Margaret Osi went to the hospital together with Mili and stayed with her during the long weeks of treatment. After the ulcer had been successfully excised, a skin transfer was necessary. The doctor removed a piece of skin from Mili's thigh.   Ulcerating infections under the skin are quite common in the forest. Some of them heal on their own. Others can be cured with a special antibiotic. If such medication is not available, the inflammation may become so severe that a sepsis is possible. Then an operation is required.  ",Margaret Osi ,"Margaret Osi . 2026. Bo Milipiro.

A crowned pigeon can provide almost twice as much meat as a chicken. Margaret once told me that one of her relatives shot one.

Sometimes the roads to Vanimo were in such a bad condition that travelling by car was not possible. People would then build rafts and travel down the Puwani to the shore, where they could find a car. This was the plan of Joe, Margaret Uma's husband. He was not experienced in navigating a raft on the river and did not know his way around hidden rocks and driftwood.
